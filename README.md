## 📌 Project Workflow  

1. **Setup & Libraries**  
   - Importing required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).  

2. **Load Dataset**  
   - Loading the Iris dataset and checking its shape.  

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checking and handling missing values.  
   - Removing duplicate rows.  
   - Ensuring consistent data types.  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing data distributions.  
   - Pair plots and correlations to understand feature relationships.  

5. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Encoding categorical variables if required.  

6. **Model Training**  
   - Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM).  
   - Hyperparameter tuning (if applied).  

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report.  

8. **Prediction**  
   - Making predictions on new/unseen data.
